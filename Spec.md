# Welcome to Contosco Music

This is techgatha music, a simple music inventory app built using expressJS, node and SQLite with the Sequelize ORM. Our goal is to create a simple web API for the public that exposes the following data:

- Browse all artists, 50 to a page
- Browse all albums, 50 to a page
- Browse all playlists, 50 to a page
- Search for an album by name using a fuzzy search

The name of the project is `contosco_music` and used Git for source control
